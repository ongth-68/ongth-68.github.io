## Do not have server yet to do Server-side Proxy
- Due to no server to handle the token revocation, currently using CORS proxy to do POST request to TikTok.
- To use public CORS proxy need go to here : https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo
- Click "request temporary access to the demo server" button

- Alternative CORS Proxy : https://corsproxy.io/?url=https://example.com
  
## TikTok currently on Sandbox version
- Due to TikTok API is apply on Sandbox only, thus the video post out does not shown in ur own account.
